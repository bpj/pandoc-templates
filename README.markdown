Templates for [pandoc](http://github.com/jgm/pandoc). Modified or created by [bpj](https://github.com/bpj).

If you use custom templates, I recommend forking [jgm's original repository](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates), since there is no guarantee that [this repository](https://github.com/bpj/pandoc-templates) is up to date with regard to changes made with newer releases of pandoc.

CHANGES
=======

I'm going to use this readme to list variables in the templates I use and what they do; primarily such variables which I've defined or changed myself, but also such which come from the default templates which I use.
