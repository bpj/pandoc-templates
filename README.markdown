Templates for [pandoc](http://github.com/jgm/pandoc).

If you use custom templates, I recommend forking [jgm's original repository](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc-templates), since there is no guarantee that this repository is up to date with regard to changes made with newer releases of pandoc.

I'm going to use this readme to list variables in the templates I use and what they do; primarily such variables which I've defined or changed myself, but also such which come from the default templates which I use.
